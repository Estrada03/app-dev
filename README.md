Battle of Earth: The climax of the film features an epic battle on Earth, where the Avengers, along with their allies, confront Thanos and his army.


Post-Credits Scene: "Avengers: Endgame" does not have a traditional post-credits scene. However, it includes a soundbite of Tony Stark hammering in the background, paying homage to the beginning of the MCU. As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, "Avengers: Endgame" is the highest-grossing film of all time, surpassing "Avatar." It earned over $2.798 billion worldwide. ![image](https://github.com/Estrada03/app-dev/assets/134744904/95d03a0a-d2a7-4759-adb2-802688b0c6ba)
