**Post-Credits Scene:** "Avengers: Endgame" does not have a traditional post-credits scene. However, it includes a soundbite of Tony Stark hammering in the background, paying homage to the beginning of the MCU. As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, "Avengers: Endgame" is the highest-grossing film of all time, surpassing "Avatar." It earned over $2.798 billion worldwide.
